# Fellowship-Software
Software used at NExScI to manage fellowship solicitation and selection

This is a PHP/MySQL web database application designed to collect applications for a
fellowship program, including letters of recommendation. Confirmation emails are sent
upon successful application and letter submission. Application materials are collected
in a password-protected area where letters can be attached to the appropriate application
and a final PDF file of the entire application, including letters, can be created.
